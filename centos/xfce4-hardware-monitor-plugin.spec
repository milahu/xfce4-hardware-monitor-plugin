%description
The Hardware Monitor plugin is an plugin for the XFCE panel which tries
to be a beautiful all-round solution to hardware monitoring. It also
tries to be user-friendly and generally nice and sensible, integrating
pleasantly with the rest of your XFCE desktop.

* Sun Aug 23 2015  OmegaPhil <OmegaPhil@startmail.com>

        Release 1.4.7

        - The plugin is now fully documented at
        http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/panel-plugins/xfce4-hardware-monitor-plugin
        - help buttons now work and launch a browser with this page.
        - Advanced users can now configure the interface names used for each
        interface type associated with the Network Monitor - this accommodates
        distros that have diverged from the standard UNIX interface naming scheme,
        and also allows users to overcome the previously hardcoded limited number
        of interfaces of the same type available to monitor at once. For everyone
        else, you can now configure 3 wireless interfaces to monitor in line with
        the number of ethernet interfaces previously. There is still an overall
        limit of 8 interfaces per plugin/visualisation.
        - The Curve visualisation/CurveView now supports a very configurable text
        overlay that allows you to see real values reported by monitors at the
        same time as the normal line graph (be sure to configure the text tags
        associated with the individual monitor sources so you don't just get a
        string of numbers) - you can also now display the maximum value of the
        graph's scale. This now makes the CurveView a fully functional network
        bandwidth graph at last.
        - Sizes and data rates now follow the proper '1024 bytes in a KB' rule.


* Fri Oct 24 2014  OmegaPhil <OmegaPhil@startmail.com>

	Release 1.4.6

	- This is mainly a release to get the project properly Debian-packaged,
	there is little to no improvement for a normal user.

	UNFORTUNATELY THIS INCLUDES A BREAKING CHANGE - the project has been
	renamed from hardware-monitor to xfce4-hardware-monitor-plugin, meaning
	that your current configuration will not automatically apply to the
	upgraded plugin - i.e. all plugin instances will disappear from the
	panel the next time you login to XFCE4.

	To prevent this from happening, please run the
	'1.4.6-upgrade-fix-xfce4-config.bash' script in this project's root
	directory after upgrading and before logging out/shutting down.


* Fri Jul 25 2014  OmegaPhil <OmegaPhil@startmail.com>

	Release 1.4.5

	- CPU usage monitor now has a fixed max value of 100% usage - output
	is no longer scaled to a changing maximum value - this allows for a
	regular CPU graph.
	- Curve monitor now uses the maximum value in its data history (which
	spans the visible line) to determine the graph maximum - there is no
	longer a gradual decay from some previous maximum. This allows for a
	normal network bandwidth graph to be configured - useful scale at
	all times, and the line is not clipped
	- Text monitor font customisation no longer overwritten on preferences
	dialog display or startup - thanks to ShapeShifter499 for bug report
	https://github.com/OmegaPhil/hardware-monitor-applet/issues/6
	- NEWS: released 1.4.5

	to 3 instead of 2 since the curve view doesn't seem to like only
	two points.
